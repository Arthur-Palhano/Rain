<h3>Just a rain simulated with P5.js</h3>

<h3>How does code work?</h3>

Each drop is generated as an element of an array, with its randomized properties, then, I simulate gravity by attracting the drops downwards, and if their position is larger than the screen, it returns to its original position with new values.

<h3>How to see the project?</h3>
